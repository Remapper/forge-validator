The Source of the Decentralized Forge Validator Node


## What is the Forge?
The Forge is a blanket-term for the Forge Validator Network, a distributed database of "Items" backed by validations and blockchain entries on the ZENZO Core protocol.

The Forge is essentially a metadata network, used to store lesser-important data instead of putting that data into the ZENZO Core blockchain, bloating it with information that, in the future, may no longer be relevent or even exist.

The Forge handles this data independently, validating it with sub-components of ZENZO Core, such as it's Blockchain and keypair signatures.
This method is lightweight and acts as a "plugin" to an already-running ZENZO Core server. Using RPC commands to verify data within the Forge network. This could be seen as something similar to IPFS or Bitcoin's Lightning Network, providing an additional layer of data processing and lessening the impact of the Core layer, without reducing security.

## How do I setup a Forge Validator?
A Forge Validator has some minor pre-requisites:
- A port-forwarded (Port 80) setup is recommended for better connectivity, but not required.
- An unlocked ZENZO Core wallet.
- Node.js

**1. Install Node.js**

Official Mirrors: https://nodejs.org/

**2. Setup ZENZO Core**

Ensure the "zenzo.conf" file has been edited to contain the following, edited to your desires:
```
txindex=1
rpcuser=user
rpcpassword=pass
listen=1
server=1
```

**3. Edit the config file**

Ensure the "data/config.json" file in the Validator's directory has been edited to your desires, and you have an address generated by your local ZENZO Core node added to your config.

**4. Start em' up**

Use command `node index` within the Validator's directory to start the node.

Your node will automatically sync up to the network, validating items and distributing them to peers it finds, if you use the built-in local endpoints with your auth-token, you can create your own items and add them to the Forge globally.
